* In My Own Words: 
    Create a function that returns the product of two numbers.
* Test Conditions: 
    multiply(2, 3) // 6
    multiply(-2, 3) // -6
* Pseudocode: 
    Return the product. This is a gimme. 
* Notes After Attempt:
    I could have made an effort to at least check for proper inputs like data type.

function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b
}

console.log(multiply(2, -3))
